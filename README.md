 # Number Plate Detection with a Multi-Convolutional Neural Network Approach with Optical Character Recognition for Mobile Devices 

 I have tried to imporved the model what was proposed in the research paper [LINK](http://jips.jatsxml.org/Article/12/1/100)

 ## About 

 The license plate is detected by sequentially applying multiple CNN-verifiers. We first performed a supervised CNN for car detection (CNN1) and second, a supervised CNN for plate detection (CNN2). Plate validation was performed with OCR by detecting digits with a third CNN-verifier (CNN3). A sliding window was used to generate input images for all classifiers.
